# Arma-Mod-Update-Checker
This piece of software is used to compare your local arma mods to the workshop to check for updates. It does not auto update mods.

This code is subject to change and update. Existing json update files should still work for newer versions if not it will be announced in the Release section.

# Known Issues
1. Certain mods do not link to a public workshop page so I cant get the update time for them for example the TSBMod has a hidden steam page so I cant get the information for it
2. Most issues not pertaining to 1 and throw an error or crash the program can be fixed via deleting the json file and re running option **1**

# Instalation Instructions
1. Download Python 3
2. Download the zip from the release page
3. Extract zip somewhere permenent (Keep files together)

# How to run this program
1. Double click on start.bat (If on Windows)
1.1 Double click on start.sh (If on Linux)
2. On first run or anytime you add a mod make sure to re-run option **1**
3. **MAKE SURE ALL MODS ARE UPDATED**
4. Run option **1**
5. After option **1** is ran it will create a json file
6. After that each time you wish to validate your mods use option **2**
7. If you just updated all the mods then run option **3** to update the json file

Please post comments and issues in the issues section and I will fix/assist.
